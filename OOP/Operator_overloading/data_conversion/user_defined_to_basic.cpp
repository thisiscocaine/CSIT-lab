// Conversion from user defined type to basic type(float(d)):

/*
To convert user defined types (objects) to basic type it is necessary to overload cast operator. 
Overloaded cast operator doesnâ€™t have return type. 
Its implicit return type is the type to which object need to be converted. 
To convert object to basic type, we use conversion function as below:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class distances
{
private:
    int feet, inch;

public:
    distances(int f, int i)
    {
        feet = f;
        inch = i;
    }
    operator float()
    { // typecast overloading
        float b = feet + inch / 12.0;
        return b;
    }
};

int main()
{
    distances d(3, 6);
    float a = float(d);
    cout << "Basic type=" << a << endl;
    return 0;
}

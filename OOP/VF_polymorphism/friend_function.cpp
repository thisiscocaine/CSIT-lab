// Friend Function
/*
A friend function can be given a special grant to access private and protected members.
- Following are some important points about friend functions and classes:
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. Too many functions or external classes declared
as friends of a class with protected or private data lessens the value of encapsulation of separate
classes in object-oriented programming.
2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A
automatically.
3) Friendship is not inherited
4) The concept of friends is not there in Java.

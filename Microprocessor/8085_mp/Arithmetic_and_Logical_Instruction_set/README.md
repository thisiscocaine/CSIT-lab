# Arithmetic and Logical Instruction Set

- [Add content of one register and another register and store the result in next register](add_content_of_registers_and_store_in_register.asm)
- [Subtract content of memory location 5000H from 5001H and store result in 5002H](subtract_contents_of_memory_location_store_in_mem.asm)
- [Add 16-bit data from register pair B and D and store result at HL pair](add_16bit_data_from_register_pair_store_in_HL_pair.asm)
- [Load 00H into register B and 10H into register C. Increment content of register B and Decrement content of register C. Store result at memory locations 4000H and 4001H](load_regB_regC_with_data_increment_b_decrement_C_store.asm)
